You don't really know
You don't really know
What it's like to be in my shoes

What it's like to be in my shoes

You can try your best to understand what is going through my mind
But ultimately you're just wasting your pathetic time
Wanna know more? Sublime, I guess we'll have a rewind
Back to a time when I could say that "me fine"

First came the fear, waking up every single day
Wondering which one of the 'rents was gonna be the one to slay
The other, I swear they fucking hated eachother



And they don't owe me shit
I get it, I-I I get it
