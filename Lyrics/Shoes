You don't really know
You don't really know
What it's like to be in my shoes

What it's like to be in my shoes

You can try your best to understand what is going through my mind
But ultimately you're just wasting your pathetic time
Wanna know more? Sublime, I guess we'll have a rewind
Back to a time when I could say that "me fine"

First came the fear, waking up every single day
Wondering which one of the 'rents was gonna be the one to slay
The other, I swear they fucking hated eachother



And they don't owe me shit
I get it, I-I I get it

You can try your best to understand what is going through my mind
But ultimately you're just wasting your pathetic time
If you really wanted to know, I guess we'd have to go back pretty far
--------
You don't what it's like to be me
And you know what, I have to respect that you see
Cause there's no mind readers in this motherfucking world
And those claim there are they make my lip curl so

Let's step back and try and get to know each other
Let's go back to when I was a little younger
When my consciousness was first apparent
and I was losing faith cause of my parents

You ever feel like a tool for cause
being paraded around for undeserved applause
behind me my parents hiding with their motherfucking jaws
pretending they were the shit and everyone was just in awe like

"
oh my god he can do math
and he can do science
and he's all this
and he's all that
"

And you know they're just eatin up the credit
Like they're out here testing me 50 times a minute nah
"
It's cus we pray all day and night
and our kids will grow to love it and never feel any spite
"
Ha, I hated that shit every day of my life
and probably will continue to until the day that I die, cus
you can't force phlip to believe
maybe some fucking evidence then we can see
but what I was given was quite contrary
hypocrits was I all perceived

Yell bout this
and yell bout that
and yell at me that you can take my life right back
