I aint got no pickup game to help me out
Please hold my hand in this emotional drought

Asked out, every girl I thought was cool
Every time the same, they all said you drool

I've tried everything that they said to do
Started hittin the gym started kickin the blues
And I make some music and I make some art
And I think I'm pretty good at taking things apart
Built my own computer, built my own world view
But I still can't seem to get a shot with you

[Pre-Chorus]
(Slow jam)
And it makes me quite sad
But aint nobody got time for that
(Slow jam end)

[Short Solo]

I've tried every method they said was true
Tinder and bumble just to name few

I've got a, couple hobbies I do outside
I run, I walk, I hike, and I climb

But it seems that just ain't quite enough
They always want just a little more stuff
