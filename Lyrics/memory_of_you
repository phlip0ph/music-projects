[Verse]
I can still remember your voice
Such a unique one, I dont have a choice
I could pick it out of a crowd
Dont ask me cause I dont know how

[Bridge]
I had such a simple request
We stayed in contact at best
But I guess that was too much for you
Who knew friends could break hearts too

[Chorus]
All I know is that I'm trying to change
Chemical reactions happening in my brain
These things they keep me depressed
They keep you recessed at best

But that's not good enough
No not good enough
I'd rather forget

[Verse]
Out of my mind and loving it, is this what I am
Another drunk or druggie, destined for the can
I cant believe this is what has come
Drinking to forget, in memorium of you

[Bridge]
In memory of you
In memory of you
This is just for you

[Chorus]
All I know is that I'm trying to change
Chemical reactions happening in my brain
These things they keep me depressed
They keep you recessed at best

[Bridge]
I had such a simple request
We stayed in contact at best
But I guess that was too much for you
Who knew friends could break hearts too

[Verse]
I swear that I'm going to change
Detachment is the new game
Who needs feelings, shit's all the same
All of them lead straight to pain

But the path is always the same, it's you
In memory of you
The memory of you
It's the memory of you
