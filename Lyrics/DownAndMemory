[Verse]
I can still remember the sound of your voice
Such a unique one I don't have a choice
I could pick it now right out of a crowd
Dont ask me why because I dont know how

[Prechorus]
I thought I had such a simple request
That we just stayed in contact at best
But I guess that was just far too much for you
Who knew that friends could break my heart too

[Chorus]
I want to forget all of the impact you made
This music made without you is so empty and without truth
Hatred nonexistant, I refuse to throw shade
I'm just sad

How could you just leave me
Did you maybe not believe me
Was I talked to outta pity
You ignore me when you see me

Try to text and call you
Forms of contact all just fall through
Were we really friends

[Verse]
Changed up your look and you had a new style
Irrelevant I knew you from a mile
Looked at the way the you walked that you talked
Seeing you there just turned up my sad dial

[Prechorus]
I thought I had such a simple request
That we just stayed in contact at best
But I guess that was just far too much for you
Ignored my call while I'm next to you

[Chorus]
I want to forget all of the impact you made
This music made without you is so empty and without truth
Hatred nonexistant, I refuse to throw shade
I'm just sad

How could you just leave me
Did you maybe not believe me
Was I talked to outta pity
You ignore me when you see me

Try to text and call you
Forms of contact all just fall through
Were we really friends

[Verse]
I suppose I should just try to not care
You clearly dont im not stuck in your hair
Forget the sound of your music and voice
I guess I should, I don't make you rejoice

[Pre-Finale]
I thought I had such a simple request
That we just stayed in contact at best
It wasn't too much no you just didn't care
About any of us around here

[Finale]
Going to forget all of the imprints you made
This music made without you is it's own thing, I know that's true
So get out of my head you damn irrelevant shade
You make me mad

How could you just leave me
Did you maybe not believe me
Was I talked to outta pity
So ironic that you're shitty

Explanation or an answer
Would be nice but you're a cancer
On my emotions
