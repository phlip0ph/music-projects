Largely feeling nothing
Just drifting through the day
Pockets of emotion pop up, then they go away

The space between them's massive
Like the space between each verse
Or the space between stars in this massive universe

And no I'm not unhappy
I swear I'm not depressed
Well maybe just a little bit, but I just need some rest
