I'm feeling just a bit down in the dumps
My mind is fried, I don't give a fuck
About anything that's happening to me
A gun, a bridge, a noose on a tree

Looking to the future and it's not looking good
Losing motivation due mental altercations
Just stuck here in a corner gonna pull up my hood
I must try

Back straight, pick my head up
New appearance, new get up
Not feeling much better
But I gotta be a go getter

So head out of the garbage
Gonna make some real good yardage
Now I'm back

Stuck in this endless loop of ups and downs
Smiles do not take long to be frowns
Over and over let's do this again
Let's see what will push me to the end

Looking to the future and it's not looking good
Losing motivation due mental altercations
Just stuck here in a corner gonna pull up my hood
I must try

Back straight, pick my head up
New appearance, new get up
Not feeling much better
But I gotta be a go getter

So head out of the garbage
Gonna make some real good yardage
Now I'm back
