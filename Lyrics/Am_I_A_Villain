All I know is that she is mad
But I don't know if I've been bad
Am I the villain that she seeks
Is it fucking really me?

I just can't see it
I can't see it
I just can't see it
Can't be me
I just can't see it
I can't see it
I just can't see it
Can't possibly

Am I really the source of
All of her frustrations
No no that can't be
[right]
That can't be
No no that can't be
[right]
Can it be?

I don't know what I should do
Should I try and talk to you
Am I the villain that you seek
Is the one who wronged you me?

I just don't know it
I don't know it
I just don't know it
Talk to me
I just don't know it
I don't know it
I just don't know it
Help me see

Am I really the source of
All of your frustrations
Can I do any[thing]
To help you
Can I do any[thing]
To love you...
