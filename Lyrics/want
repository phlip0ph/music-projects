Dont know what I want
I guess Ill have to think about it
Need a mental shunt
Just some to think about now

Dont know what I want
How do I even think about it
Brain dead in a rut
So many years just thinking bout it
I know what to do
Just go ahead and ask somebody

You know what you want?
Go ahead and tell me bout it

Oh wait, you dont know
Lemme just consult some others
Oh wait, they dont know
Lemme just construct some others
No one fucking knows
What they want to do with their life

Shit just comes along
And then have you go with it now
No one fucking knows
Cant begin to make heads or toes
No one fucking knows
And everybody knows that it blows

Dont know what I want
Not even gonna think about it
Not worth mental tugs
What's the point of thinking bout it
